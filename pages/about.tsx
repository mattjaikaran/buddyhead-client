          {`Yep, Buddyhead is back. This webzine was established in 1998 so 
          it's kind of poetic for it to reappear on its 25th anniversary. 
          The focus of the site is and has also been to shed light on things that normally wouldn't get the attention they deserve. That includes music, politics, films, art or whatever else that excites us. We are currently accepting applications for designers, writers and content creators who share this vision and would like to contribute to this project.`}

          If you think you got what it takes and are into not getting paid then
          shoot Travis an email at tmk@buddyhead.com with some examples of your
          work.

          And yes Buddyhead is still releasing records, new vinyl from The
